## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I've discovered the transformative power of Flexbox in crafting responsive layouts, providing a seamless experience across various devices. Transitioning from inline-block elements to Flexbox has not only streamlined the design process but also mitigated layout inconsistencies. Furthermore, implementing subtle box-shadow transitions upon hover has elevated the aesthetics and interactivity of the interface, enhancing user engagement.

Here's a snippet demonstrating the use of Flexbox

```css
#profile-details-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  width: 100%;
  align-items: center;
}
```
